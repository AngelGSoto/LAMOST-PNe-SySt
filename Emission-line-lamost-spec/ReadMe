Abstract:
    Current archives of the LAMOST telescope contain millions of
    pipeline-processed spectra that have probably never been seen by human
    eyes. Most of the rare objects with interesting physical properties,
    however, can only be identified by visual analysis of their
    characteristic spectral features. A proper combination of interactive
    visualisation with modern machine learning techniques opens new ways
    to discover such objects.

    We apply active learning classification methods supported by deep
    convolutional neural networks to automatically identify complex
    emission-line shapes in multi-million spectra archives.

    We used the pool-based uncertainty sampling active learning method
    driven by a custom-designed deep convolutional neural network with 12
    layers. The architecture of the network was inspired by VGGNet,
    AlexNet, and ZFNet, but it was adapted for operating on
    one-dimensional feature vectors. The unlabelled pool set is
    represented by 4.1 million spectra from the LAMOST data release 2
    survey. The initial training of the network was performed on a
    labelled set of about 13000 spectra obtained in the 400{AA} wide
    region around H{alpha} by the 2m Perek telescope of the Ondrejov
    observatory, which mostly contains spectra of Be and related
    early-type stars. The differences between the Ondrejov
    intermediate-resolution and the LAMOST low-resolution spectrographs
    were compensated for by Gaussian blurring and wavelength conversion.

    After several iterations, the network was able to successfully
    identify emission-line stars with an error smaller than 6.5%. Using
    the technology of the Virtual Observatory to visualise the results, we
    discovered 1013 spectra of 948 new candidates of emission-line objects
    in addition to 664 spectra of 549 objects that are listed in SIMBAD
    and 2644 spectra of 2291 objects identified in an earlier paper of a
    Chinese group led by Wen Hou. The most interesting objects with
    unusual spectral properties are discussed in detail.

Description:
    Tables containing spectra of emission stars identified by active deep
    learning (ADL) of the paper.

    The table "cans-bad.dat" contains spectra identified as bad, either
    due to reduction artifacts, extreme noise or due to their wrong class
    (e.g. pure absorption), despite the prediction of a spectrum as an
    emission-line object. However, there are some interesting objects as
    well.

    The table "cans-hou.dat" contains spectra identified by our ADL method
    and also by Hou et al. (2016RAA....16..138H). If we were able to
    cross-match them with SIMBAD the relevant data from SIMBAD are given
    as well. The table "cans-new.dat" contains spectra of yet unknown
    emission stars (neither cross-matched with SIMBAD, nor discovered by
    Hou et al., 2016RAA....16..138H). They deserve further examination.

    The table "cans-sim.dat" contains spectra of emission stars discovered
    by ADL which were sucessfully cross-matched with SIMBAD within 20
    arcsec radius. They were not found by Hou et al.
    (2016RAA....16..138H). In fact they may serve, together with the
    "cans-hou.dat", as a resource of relatively recent spectra of known
    emission line objects.

Global Notes:
Note (G1): SDSS r magnitude from LAMOST FITS header. It is according to
    Luo et al. (2015RAA....15.1095L, Cat. V/146) the main parameter for target
    selection. It is also an estimate of brightness of the star in Halpha
    spectral region.
Note (G2): Class assigned by our active deep learning method. It is either
    "emission" (single-peak emission) or "double peak" (double-peak emission).
